# Etch-A-Sketch

Basic Front-End project, using JavaScript and CSS Grid to create a grid of squares that are colored when hovered over.
Afterwards, a functionality was added to reset the grid by clicking the button on top and choosing the number of cells you want per side.

The project can be accessed at https://gscerveira.github.io/etch-a-sketch/.
